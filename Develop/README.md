# Horiseon Social Solutions

**Version 1.1.0**

This repository is for the work of the company Horiseon. They are social solutions company helping other companies reach out to people that may be interested in their product/apps/etc. This project was caused by Horiseon needing to update their codebase to follow accessibility standards. As well having their site being optimized for their own SEO.

I worked on the code of both html and css. The source code will be provide so that what was improved on and also reworked can be seen side by side with the original text.

HTML
    <ul>
        <li>All blocks were labeled nonsemantically as div so I gave them proper block labels.</li>
        <li>The title was left as document so that the SEO of the site was poor. Switched the title to "Horiseon Social Solutions" being the name of the company.</li>
        <li>Spacing of the code was a bit messy so I made sure that everything was nicely spaced when editing is needed.</li>
        <li>Images needed alt attributes for better Search Engine results. These were added to all images to help.</li>
        <li>Search Engine Optimization link was not working so that needed to fixed.</li>
    </ul>
CSS
    <ul>
        <li>Add comments to all working code so that it is clear what is being done by each element.</li>
        <li>There was elements that were used multiple times so these were consolidated by the corresponding classes that matched with each other so that the CSS file could be shrunken down. </li>
        <li>Some of the classes were named after the element in CSS that was applied to them so I gave them more uniquely semantic names so in the future if they are changed they won't being improperly labeled.</li>
    </ul>
